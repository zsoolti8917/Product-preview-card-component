## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

This challange was amongst my first, i followed Kevin Powell's tutorial on youtube so the code is not my owen but it geratly helped me understand how to use flexbox and grid. I also learned how to use media queries and how to make a responsive website. It greatly contributed to my current knowledge of web development.



### Continued development

i dont plan to add anything more to this project. I think it's finished and i'm happy with it. I will continue to learn and practice with new projects.
